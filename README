Welcome to the README for MC Server GUI

This project is in it's infancy still and I'm also still learning how to use GIT, so please bear with me.

This was built in Windows 7 Ultimate with autohotkey.
My guess is that it will work fine for XP/2000/Vista/7 but I can't garauntee it'll work on other OS.



Installation is pretty simple:
1. Unzip mcservergui.exe somewhere
    (I recommend just putting them both in your minecraft server folder.)
2. Run mcservergui.exe and click on Server Config
3. Modify these settings to your needs but most importantly locate your MC Server Jar file

That's it!
