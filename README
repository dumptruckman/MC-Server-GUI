Welcome to the README for MC Server GUI

This project is in it's infancy still and I'm also still learning how to use GIT, so please bear with me.

This was built in Windows 7 Ultimate with autohotkey.
My guess is that it will work fine for XP/2000/Vista/7 but I can't garauntee it'll work on other OS.



Installation is pretty simple:
1. Place mcservergui.exe in the same folder as the guiconfig.ini.
    (I recommend just putting them both in your minecraft server folder.)
2. Edit guiconfig.ini and most importantly change the settings under [Folders]
3. Change the other settings as you see fit.

That's it!

Run the exe and enjoy.
