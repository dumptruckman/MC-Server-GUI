Welcome to the README for MC Server GUI

This was built in Windows 7 Ultimate with autohotkey.
My guess is that it will work fine for XP/2000/Vista/7 but I can't garauntee it'll work on other OS.



Installation is pretty simple:
1. Unzip mcservergui.exe and 7za.exe (This file is for archiving ability) into your Minecraft Server directory
2. Run mcservergui.exe.  It will attempt to detect the jar file for your server.  If it cannot find it, set it manually under Server Config.

That's it!
