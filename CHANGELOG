Version .6.6
  Added some very specific debug mode values to fight this zero-console output issue
  Added option to enable/disable minimize to tray
  Added more checks for the GUI closing (other than the X button) so that it can shut down the server properly
  Removed error message about GetGUIThreadInfo()
  Made one tiny change to the startup process that may increase reliability

Version .6.5
  Added a new text box to show the phases of the start up process (instead of displaying in the console output), allowing for:
  Modified the startup process.  It will now start displaying console output much sooner
  Fixed issue where auto-restarts made the GUI think Java was crashing
  Replaced Warn Restart button with Warn Stop button as this would seem to be more useful
  Renamed Immediate Restart button to just Restart
  Added Reload button to send the reload command for you
  Made Minimize to Tray much more reliable

Version .6.4
  Fix for restart times not updating correctly while the server is running

Version .6.3
  Player list should no longer display duplicate players
  Fixed bug where Next Restart time would reset to the next restart time shortly after saying it was commencing the first one
  Possibly fixed a bug that would cause restarts (and therefore backups) to be skipped
  Added Debug Mode
  Fixed issue where console would remain blank on server start
  Now minimizes to the system tray
  System tray icon's tooltip shows server status and if UP, online player count
  Possibly fixed bug where server up time would stop displaying
  Fixed issue where sometimes the GUI would erroneously think that there was a Java error upon starting the server
  Removed Update Rate setting as it is no longer used
  The console output should resume scrolling normally when you're not focused on it (such as selecting text within it)
  Should now detect players being kicked by alternate means
  
Version .6.2
  Added server up time display
  Re-added Show Java Console toggle since there is still some server start issues
  Added "Auto-Restart In" time indication
  Added count to Player List
  GUI automatically creates a backup folder if one does not already exist
  Split source code into multiple files
  Added new Automate Backups checkbox... No new functionality, just makes it simpler to run manual backups
  Corrected restart behavior so that if you start the server during an automated restart, it will not immediately restart the server upon next stop
  Fixed bug where restart times (without date) earlier than current time would get skipped

Version .6.1
  Restart times can be entered in a whole lot more formats. examples: 2011/1/24 10pm, 11am, 5:55:05
  Can also enter one additional time which is how long after server start to restart. example: 10h40m
  Restart times will no longer start your server if they did not cause it to restart
  GUI now only tells the server to reconnect in X seconds on the final warning time
  Informs the user that backups are skipped on manual restarts
  Made it more apparent that the server stops when you close the GUI (It also waits to make SURE it closes)

Version .6.0
  Consolidated some buttons
  Reorganized main window
  Added CPU monitor for server
  Added Memory and CPU monitor for GUI
  Added network statistics (Please note, this is for ALL network activity for the server PC)
  Possible fix for certain players not showing up in the player list
  Seconds are now converted to minutes and seconds
  Possible fix, or at least work-around, for path doesn't exist messages
  Can now archive backups to zip file
  Fixed bug where removing worlds from your world list didn't actually remove them
  Autodetects server jar file if not set

Version .5.5
  Now able to send exclamation marks to the server!
  Possible fix for players sometimes not showing up in the list

Version .5.4
  Lowered default font size to 8
  Added player list right-click menu.  Kick and ban people with just a couple clicks!
  Fix for Show Java Console button
  Added console output right-click menu.  You can now easily copy text from the console output!
  Added checkbox to default console input to "say" mode
  Optionally you can press shift+enter to send in "say" mode
  Added option to always show Java console

Version .5.3
  Memory now displays current usage / max allowed
  Replaced World Backups checkbox with Manual Backup button
  Backups only run when the server is restarted automatically, run them manually with the new Manual Backup button
  Added a significant amount of extra error checking on the startup process
  Removed log initialization upon finding a much simpler, more reliable method
  Player list should be a bit more reliable.  It still needs work, however
  Added additional error checking to backup process
  Forced GUI to wait to start server until backups are finished.  This should have already been the case but sometimes wasn't
  Buttons should never be disabled/enabled at improper times anymore

Version .5.2
  Added option to start server on GUI startup
  Startup errors now log to guierror.log, in addition, the message box times out in 5 seconds
  If there is a startup error while attempting a scheduled restart, the GUI will try to start the server until it succeeds

Version .5.1
  Fixed player list bug which allowed for players that have logged off to stay on the list
  Unfortunately, people with Nick Names will be tracked poorly due to this
  Removed MC Server Path box as the server jar file already specifies that
  Rearranged startup process.  Added error checking.  Server start up should be much more reliable and if not, it will give you an error message and cancel the start process.
  Making some structural changes to the GUI layout, moving towards a resizeable gui

Version .5.0
  Added basic player list
  When Console Input doesn't have focus, typing while on the Main Window tab will give it focus
  WAITS for Java Console to exist before trying to hook it, this SHOULD make Start Server work every time
  Added tooltips to a lot of things in the GUI.  Try hoving your mouse over an item to get more info
  
Version .4.1
  Submit button works again >.>

Version .4.0
  Keeps hooked Java Console now, keep it from working fine and then suddenly not working
  Disables buttons instead of giving error messages when they can't be used
  Added Save Worlds button
  Using Rich Edit control instead of plain old Edit, which made the following possible:
  Text now scrolls down!
  As such, input box is below the console box
  Added ability to change the font face/size/color and background color
  Also able to colorize INFO, WARNING, and SEVERE message tags
  
Version .3.5
  Reduced spam on server start when your log is not fresh

  Added version indicator
  Added a button to show/hide the Java Console
  Moved some elements around a bit
  Added error checking for file/folder names
  No longer stores the path for server jar, just filename (Increases compatibility)

Version .3.3
  Forgot to hide the java window in the last version. Fixed~

Version .3.2
  Possibly fixed bug where GUI would lose track of the actual MC Server and cause a lot of other problems
  This includes the server starting then all of a sudden saying it isn't running

Version .3.1

  Runs straight java now without going through cmd.exe
  Creates config file automatically
  Allows editing of config inside of GUI
  Temporarily removed both restart options due to strange bugs 
  No more lag on the text entry box clearing
  Added some slight coloration, more to come
