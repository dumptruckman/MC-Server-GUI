Todo list for MC Server GUI in no specific order:

Ability to give players items by right clicking name in player list
Plugin list with possible integration with plugman
Compatibility with many other plugins (mcMMO or iConomy for instance)
Server file manipulation (like installing/configuring plugins)
More Error Checking
Resizeable GUI
Minimize to tray
Extra restart messages?
Customizable restart messages
Full, archived, backups of server (plugins and all)
Add ability to restart based on memory limits
Warnings when the server could be lagging
Change the restart scheduler to something more robust ^_^
Special GUI op only commands, such as restarting, restart + backup, and timed restarting (suggestions?)
Possibly have cooperability with something like MccRestart
Detect 7za exit codes
Delete backups after x amount of time or x amount of backups
